Liasis-Graph
===========

A Graph / Digraph implementation in Python.

In order to test the application, run `make` from "liasis-graph" folder (well, actually the same folder of this README).

We've [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) as a prerequisite, that's needed for better unit tests (more verbose at output), however you can execute the tests without it. Our makefile already handles that, so you don't have to worry. If you already have *nose* installed we will use it, otherwise we'll run directly from Python.
